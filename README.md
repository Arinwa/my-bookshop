DA218 Assignment 1

The assignment involves creating a single-page web shop or online store dedicated to selling computer books focusing on frontend development. Data regarding the books must be retrieved from a JSON file adhering to specific formatting guidelines. It is prohibited to hardcode any book data directly into the HTML, CSS, or JS files.

The shop features four main categories: UX, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each containing a minimum of five book titles, totaling at least 20 titles overall.

The shop has a list of books that can be filtered by category, author, and price interval, with the ability to sort by title (ascending and descending), price (ascending and descending), and author (ascending and descending).

Furthermore, the shop should offered a detailed view accessible by clicking on a book in the list, complete with a buy button displayed alongside each book in both the list and detailed view. Each book has a unique image associated with it.

There is a shopping cart that users can toggle to show or hide as desired. The shopping cart displays the selected books, including the title, quantity, price per book, and subtotal for each item, followed by the total sum of the cart's contents. No checkout functionality was implemented.

The web shop is a Single Page Application (SPA), with JavaScript generating all content dynamically. Bootstrap was utilized to ensure a responsive design for the web shop.

To run the application:
1. Clone it
2. Unzip and open the folder in a code editor such as VS Code
2. Run: npm install in the terminal
4. Run: npm run dev in the terminal
